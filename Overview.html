			        <p> As Australia’s population grows, so does its need for robust, scalable transport infrastructure. As the federal and state governments coordinate building new roads, railways, tram lines and other transport routes. The computerised management system for using this infrastructure becomes increasingly difficult to manage.</p>
				<p> There are currently, six different Transport networks across the country that administer and regulate their own public transport systems. Although all systems are capable of providing public transport, albeit to varying degrees, this comes with considerable downside. Lack of interoperability between state systems forces customers to capitulate to each state’s fees, rules and regulations. </p>
			        <p> What we propose to build is a centralised software platform that is capable of utilising existing transport infrastructure in each state, allowing them to communicate with one another. </p>
				<p> The idea behind public transport is to allow the average commuter unfettered access to areas that would otherwise prove challenging without a vehicle of some kind. As previously mentioned, current public transport systems are localised to each states respective cities. The question is why? We believe that a true public transport system would and should allow a commuter to travel anywhere Public transport is available, regardless of what state they are in. </p>
				<p> The ultimate goal of this project is connection and ease of use. We want to connect people with each other and to Businesses, points of interests, tourist attractions and so on. </p>
				<p> Consider a tourist who is planning a trip around Australia, visiting each state. Public transport is the only viable option for those wanting to get around relatively cheap. Research would need to go into what travel cards they would need to purchase, different fare rates,etc… In contrast, our proposed card would take out the hassle of planning PT needs when in Australia as the card would be accepted country wide. </p>	
				<p> Tackling a project like this would show an employer that we are able to work within an existing technology infrastructure to improve its effectiveness.Being able to recycle existing technology is paramount to saving costs. </p>

				<p> PT systems in Australia are largely government owned and run with no competitors. However, part of Melbourne’s infrastructure has been privatised through the state government's’ decision to outsource to Metro Trains and Yarra Trams. If other state governments decide to follow suit and put out tenders to maintain the public transport system than this will foster a competitive environment in which private companies compete. </p>	
				<p> Our system would privatise the maintenance required to keep the public transport infrastructure running smoothly while the actual administration of the new card itself would be run by the government. </p>
