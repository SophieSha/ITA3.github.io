					<h4> Daniel </h4>
				
			        <p> Myers-Briggs Test:   I have been classified as having an INTJ personality which is a part of the “Rational” family. In a nutshell, my decision making comes from a place of measured thought, relying on facts, observations and objective truths to make an informed decision. It also means that I can be, at times, a little hard to get to know.</p>
				      <p> Learning Style Test:   My results were: 25% Auditory, 35% Visual and 40% tactile. This means that my I learn best through practical application of concepts I would otherwise learn in from a book or speaker. I find that I gain experience regardless of whether something is done correctly or not and I learn from it.</p>
				      <p> Creativity Test:   My top 3 metrics are: Complexity, Curiosity and Connection. Complexity is “the ability to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information” . Curiosity is “the desire to change or improve things that everyone else accepts as the norm.” Connection is “the ability to make connections between things that don't initially have an apparent connection.” </p>
					
				
					<h4> Davin </h4>
				
			        <p> Myers-Briggs Test:   My results on the Myers Briggs Test indicates that I am ‘The Consul’ (ESFJ-A). This means that I value teamwork and comradery rather than individualism, and I would try to ensure a fair distribution of workload amongst the members. Personality wise I am quite shy and timid at any initial stage of interaction with another individual, however after getting to know each other and spending some time together, I would find it easier to be more open towards my peers. </p>
				      <p> Learning Style Test:   For my learning styles I was classed into three categories; 40% Visual Learner, 40% Auditory Learner, and a subclass of 20% Tactile or Kinesthetic Learner. This meant that I can quickly understand something better when I both see and hear instead of the counterpart of studying quietly. In addition to aid in understanding the topic better I also am able to learn by conducting practicals. Although i strive on learning quickly by communication and sight, my results from the Myers Briggs test points out that there is a limit to how many people can be within a team for me, that limit is 5. Anymore can cause unnecessary distraction which could potentially hinder my ability to work. </p>
			     	  <p> Big Five Personality Test:   The results for my Big Five Personality Test, also known as OCEAN in short, indicates that i’m quite disciplined with myself and promote a stress-free environment. This can be very beneficial to the team due to my eagerness to work hard from the get-go instead of procrastinating to the last few weeks or days. Aside from keeping a structured plan, I also am able to make rational decisions by my calm nature instead of allowing stress to burden me.  </p>
					
          
					<h4> Shane </h4>
				
			        <p> Myers-Briggs Test:   (ESTJ-A) The test result says that I’m a practical person that likes to work in a logical manner that prioritises rational thought over emotional decisions. I enjoy a structured and planned environment of life as opposed to spontaneity. I tend to get along well with other people and tend to want to have a goal or objective to work towards and tend to focus on what is happening or has happened. In a team the test result could influence my behaviour by wanting to do things in a logical manner completing each step before moving to the next.  </p>
				      <p> Learning Style Test:   I am predominantly a visual learner. Having things written down or pictures will help me to remember and understand. So in terms of team, having communications in a written form (weather it is via online chat or written down during face to face) would also be beneficial to me.</p>
			     	  <p> Big Five Personality Test:   The middle to high conscientiousness indicates that I am a conscientious, disciplined, efficient and well organised person. And very low openness to experience also says that I am a traditionalist, down-to-earth, practical and a bit conservative. While forming a team ideally, I would like to group up with like minded people as having people who tend to be spontaneous and responsible to group work. </p>
					
          
					<h4> Sophie </h4>
				
			        <p> Myers-Briggs Test:   (ISTJ) The test result shows that I am a serious and quiet person, interested in security and peaceful living. I am extremely thorough, responsible, and dependable. I am well-organized and hardworking, enjoy working steadily towards my identified goals.</p>
				      <p> Learning Style Test:    The assessment result shows that I am a tactile/kinesthetic learner and I should make good use of computer and internet to learn. As an IT student, this is definitely a great result to me. Using computer and internet would maximize my chance to make contribution in a team. Refer to team member selection, having good computer skills would be a very important selection criteria. </p>
			     	  <p> Big Five Personality Test:   The test indicates that I am a well-organized and highly responsible person. In a team, these characteristics may benefit my group work very well by encouraging team members actively working towards the group project to achieve excellent outcomes. When forming a team I would also consider about what positive personality characteristics that other people can bring to the team so that we could form a well-balanced and motivated team to accomplish group tasks successfully.   </p>
					
          
					<h4> Wenshuo </h4>
				
			        <p> Myers-Briggs Test:   Defender Personality (ISFJ, -A/-T) Defender personality is quite unique. I have excellent analytical abilities but sensitive, enable to build robust social relationships but still reserved. I am often receptive to change and new ideas and try my best to strive for win-win situations. Doing tasks reliable and patient with great enthusiastic. </p>
				      <p> Learning Style Test:   Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a written language format or in another visual format such as pictures or diagrams. </p>
			     	  <p> Big Five Personality Test:   Practical caretaker This Big Five assessment measures my scores on five major dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated as OCEAN). Your score for openness was low, at 46%, I probably think of myself as a practical, down-to-earth person and most comfortable in familiar surroundings. My score for conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism was 46%,48% 69% and 46% respectively. Overall, my core values and motivations is practical caretakers.  </p>
