				<p> Our team has been in existence for about four and a half weeks. As a whole, we can be proud to say that we have done a pretty good job. On the premise of quality assurance, we completed the whole A3 work together very efficiently. </p>
				<p> At the time we formed the team, we divided our members into two sub-groups in a very simple and interesting way, namely boys group and girls group. The boys group only focus on exploring our project in depth, while the girls were responsible for taking care of all the other content required for the report as well as assisting the boys group whenever needed. This approach maximizes everyone's strengths. Since the project of our group was originally from a former group where two of the boy members were from, therefore they already had a very good understanding of the project and had completed half of the contents required by A3 when the group was formed. The girls in our group are very good at designing so it’s better to let them to do all the designing jobs to achieve the best results. </p>
				<p> Another important aspect about this group is that we have a very positive attitude and frequent good communication. In addition to typing on Discord, we also organized many classroom meetings, audio conferences and presentation rehearsals. Even though we all had work to do, we all tried to be there. The sense of belonging in a group is the key factor to its long-term survival. So we all treated our teammates like friends and tried to create a comfortable communication environment. Now, toward the end of the Assignment 3, we have become friends who support each other, instead of former teammates who dislike each other. </p>
				<p> To sum up, it’s obvious that almost everyone is satisfied with this group experience. And I have to say, we are not difficult people, we just need to meet the others with different talents but the same enthusiasm. </p>
