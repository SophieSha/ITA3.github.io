			        <p> There should be no tests done before week 7 or ,at worst, week 9 since that is allocated for research and general feedback. The goal of weeks 1 to the end of week 6 is to gather information of the existing systems, the problems, possible solutions, and user feedback of the current systems in place. Development will begin at the start of week 7 which revolves around the web application and the actual code for the MIFARE DESFire Chip. Aside from a day to day test of the current system as we progress there will be weekly major tests to ensure the progress made is functional. </p>
				<p> At the end of week 7  our first main test will begin which will mainly revolve around the web application. The questions we ask during this week are; </p>
				
				<ul>  
				<li> Is the Web-Application completed? </li>	
				<li> Are the basic functions implemented? (Sign up and Log in) </li>	
				<li> Are there any bugs within the Web-Application?
				   
				    <ul>  
				    <li> Do all the buttons lead to the correct corresponding page? </li>	
				    <li> Is the layout able to work on the Computer? </li>	
				    <li> Is the layout able to work on Mobile Devices? </li>	
				    <li> Is the layout able to work on Tablets? </li>	    	    
				    </ul>
					
				</li>	
				</ul>
				
					
				<p> Week 8 will complement week 7’s development which will be spent fixing out any bugs that exist in the current system. However in this week we will pour more time into the development of the Chip and ensure the code works. In this week the questions we ask during the testing phase are; </p>
				
				<ul>  
				<li> Any bugs within the Web-Application? </li>	
				<li> Any bugs or errors within the programming of the Chip? </li>		
				</ul>
					
					
				<p> Assuming progress goes smoothly, both the Web Application and Chip are completed. Week 9 tests will be based on whether the chip is able to interact with the PN7462 Reader. In this phase we will be looking to test; </p>	
				
				<ul>  
				<li> Whether the Touch On and Off feature works </li>	
				<li> Whether the funds will be deducted upon Touching On </li>	
				<li> Whether the funds will be automatically deducted if the user forgets to Touch Off at the end of the trip </li>	
				</ul>	
				
					
					
				<p> Week 10 will be dedicated towards developing and testing whether the card is able to interact with the current top up vending machines and whether the autopay function works via the web application. For the success of this project we will request for private access to a current PTV machine to ensure that users will be able to top-up their PT-Cards. The reason for having an actual machine rather than creating a mock is to eliminate any possibility of mistakes. Creating a mock machine will mean that there is a chance the system will not be similar. In addition to errors, the cost of roll outs would be significantly less if the vending machines do not need to be replaced. The second goal of week 10 testing will be to ensure the cards auto-top-up feature is functional. </p>
				<p> By the end of week 11 the project should have completed Alpha testing and proceed to move towards Beta testing. The primary goal of this week is to assemble a group of target users to conduct tests and provide feedback on the new application and system. In terms of documentation a draft should have been completed based on Alpha testing including any existing bugs that still needs to be fixed in the later weeks. </p>	
				<p> With a group of target users who volunteered to test our system we can proceed with week 12’s testing. In this phase of the project the development team will split into two groups, the first group will focus on the existing bugs of past weeks that was found, and the second group will work together alongside the testing group to locate and fix any discovered issues. </p>
				<p> Week 13 will mainly be based on the collaboration between the allocated development team and the testers of the product. In this week we mainly will be testing and asking for; </p>	
				<p> Are there any complications in using the current system? </p>
				
				<ul>  
				<li> Web Application 
				    <ul>  
				    <li> Whether testers can Sign Up or Log In </li>	
				    <li> Whether testers can add funds </li>	
				    <li> Whether testers can view the content of the page properly </li>	
				    <li> Whether testers are happy with the layout and design of the website </li>	    	    
				    </ul>
				</li>	
				
		
				<li> Card 
				    <ul>  
				    <li> Whether testers can Touch On and Off without errors </li>	
				    <li> Whether testers are happy with the time taken to Touch On or Off </li>	    	    
				    </ul>
				</li>		
				</ul>	
					
	
			        <p> Week 14 will be where the team wraps up the project, fixing any bugs or errors that were found from the testing team. The only tests done at this week is to ensure everything is in proper working order. Assuming progress is made without further errors, the team is able to prepare for the evaluation phase of the project which takes place in weeks 15 and 16. During the evaluation phase the purpose of the team is to ensure the project is able to be pushed out for Beta testing starting at the suburban areas of Perth. </p>
