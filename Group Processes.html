			        <p>My group for assignment 3 has changed drastically, with 3 new members joining. My group in assignment 2 was not great at communicating with one another, particularly when it came to missing meetings and general work discussion. We didn’t fall behind thanks to our work meeting during the mid semester break where we were able to get a bulk of the work completed. Although, in the end we were able to complete the work, it would have progressed more smoothly if we were all on the same page.
 </p>
				<p> Similarly to the group for assignment 2, we have opted to expedite the report writing stage to focus on the presentation aspect of the project. In addition we will be using Discord as our main channel of communication.</p>

			        <p> The previous group for assignment 2 was honestly quite rough. It ranged from members who basically appeared once in a blue moon, to members who pulled more weight than they should've. It was a fascinating experience and one that I'm quite thankful of since I was able to learn how to distinguish between the good and the bad.  The movement to assignment 3 however made drastic changes in terms of members. I've left my old group to remake a new one with 3 new people. Alongside me was an existing member from assignment 2 that agreed to join in for assignment 3.
 </p>
				<p> Assignment 2, in my opinion, had a fantastic start completing various tasks on the first week after it's initial release. Sad to say cracks appeared after the first week and hindered further progress for a good amount of time. The benefits of the cracks, however, gave the group experience how to fix any internal issues which would ultimately benefit future group related work by ensuring no further cracks would appear. On communications, the experience that I will be happy to bring towards assignment 3 is the use of Discord as our main communication platform. The initial use of Whatsapp on assignment 2 just proved disastrous results. </p>

			        <p> In assignment 2 I was part of another group that had relatively poor communication overall. It was pretty frustrating as only about half of the group was actively using our agreed communication method and working on the report in a consistent manner. It really showed a large separation about who was taking the assignment seriously. Towards the end of assignment 2 I heard of similar issues that some of my classmates were having.
 </p>
				<p> For assignment 3 I have formed a group with other classmates that I already have good communication with. We have planned out our specific tasks to be completed and are going to be having regular meetings with an open channel for communication to talk through.
 </p>
					
					
					
					<h4 style="color:#000000"> Sophie</h4>
				
			        <p> I have changed my group for assignment 3 mainly because I really would like to have a group that has got better communication and enough passion towards the assignment. I love to meet good team players whenever dealing with group work and I know in this new group the members are all trustworthy and have good intentions to work together like a team.   </p>
				<p> We will have regular small group meetings in both class and Discord channel to assign tasks and exchange assignment related information. We will make good use of each members talents and skills to achieve the best possible results of the assignment 3 and we will also help each other whenever difficulties appear. 
 </p>

			        <p> Actually, we did a quite good job generally in my assignment 2 group. All group members were very professional and serious for their own tasks, completed on time with good quality. Even though group communication was rocky in the beginning stage, as people were not responsive enough on Messenger, but it has improved greatly since we had a serious group meeting.
 </p>
				<p> For assignment 3, Sophie and I left the original group and formed a new group with 3 new students cause I indeed would like to work with positive group member with great passions. We made a work plan and everyone had no problem with our work distribution. We also decided to use discord as our chat app at the beginning, make sure every member sign up an account and ready to use it, then organize online meetings regularly.
