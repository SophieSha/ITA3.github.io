					<h4> A1 Planning </h4>
				
			        <p> Coming up with an original idea proved difficult with every idea I had come up with had some sort of proof of concept available online. However, as this a bad thing? I began to look at systems that, in their current state, could do with some improvements by imagining that I was a user of a product. I played this scenario for a number of products before landing on Myki. I landed on them for their woeful implementation and administration of Melbourne’s public transport system to their inability to provide a satisfactory experience for their users. In addition, I wanted to pick a problem area that many people, not just myself, could relate to on a personal level. </p>
				<p> Now that the project idea had begun to form, I was faced with the important question: What needed to change? I kept coming back to the Myki card itself and its disadvantages such as; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> Cards dont state what type of card it is? (E.g. Full fare, concession, tertiary) </li>
                                <li> Anonymous nature of the card means that if you lose it, its gone. </li>
				<li> If you’ve forgotten your card at home, you are forced to go home and get it or purchase a new one on the spot. </li>	
				<li> The card can only be used in Melbourne. </li>
                                <li> Putting travel funds onto the card can be slow depending on payment method (E.g. Funds can take up to a day to appear on the card when paying via Myki’s portal. </li>
				<li> Card reading does not always work or is rather slow. </li>
                                <li> Very little oversight and control over the card. </li>
				
				</ul>	
				
					
				<p> The last step for formulating the project idea was: How could I improve on delivering what Myki does? It is no surprise to anyone that the general consensus towards Myki has been negative and rightfully so. I began thinking about  how I could deliver a solution to solve the above mentioned issues. Initial thoughts were to design an application that could be downloaded onto anyone’s phone and use the phone’s NFC capabilities to act as the card itself. Users would be able to touch on and off, check their balance on the fly, pay directly from their bank accounts ( if they so choose) and use it anywhere in Australia. This seemed like the perfect delivery method. It solved; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> Checking what type of account you have (it would be stated in the application) </li>
                                <li> Card wouldn’t be anonymous ( card’s unique RFID signature would be linked to the phone) </li>
				<li> People are far less likely to forget their phone. </li>	
				<li> The app could be used anywhere in Australia. </li>
                                <li> Putting funds onto the card would generally be quicker. </li>
				<li> More account control options. </li>
                               
				</ul>
					
					
				<p> However, I soon found out that there were quite a few, significant holes in the plan that needed to be considered. These include but are not limited to; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> App development may prove extremely difficult as many makes and models of phones exist in Australia. The likelihood of device-specific bugs will be quite difficult to anticipate during initial rollout. Also, developing fixes to specific device bugs may prove to be a time and resource intensive exercise. </li>
                                <li> There could be device-specific security flaws that could be exploited to steal people’s information. </li>
				<li> Convincing governments to work together towards a common agenda when they are more concerned what they would get out of the plan, not what would be best for their people. </li>	
				
				</ul>
					
					
				<p> To reiterate, formulating the project idea revolved around 3 main questions/aspects; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> What could be improved upon for the betterment of people? </li>
                                <li> What aspect of the above situation needed to change? </li>
				<li> How would we implement this change? </li>	
						
				</ul>
					
					
					<h4> A2 Planning </h4>
				        
					<p>  </p>
					
					<h5> Challenges </h5>
					
			        <p> Continuing from Assignment 2, we believed the most daunting challenge would be to have the cooperation from the federal or state governments of the current 8 public transport systems. Not only are the approval from the collective 8 a major hurdle, but to demonstrate the boons of the new system will also require a strong case. We are required to make a strong point by demonstrating a functioning system without proper public tests, a demonstration of the benefits of swapping from the 8 current system into just 1 system even if the current system are already implemented and fully functional. </p>
				<p> Following the main hurdles are some questions that we were required to answer such as; </p>
				
				<ul>
                                
				<li> Do we have to renew all the current readers of the system? This involves all transport modes; Train, Tram, Bus, Ferry. </li>
                                <li> Do we have to renew all the current machines users use to Top-Up on? </li>
				<li> Will users have to swap their old card for a new card? </li>	
				<li> Will users have to pay to swap their old cards for the new card? </li>
				<li> How much will all of this cost? And who will pay for this? </li>
                                
				</ul>
				
					
				<p> As for implementation the project team has agreed to a 2 stage implementation which involves an initial stage and an end stage. The initial stage will revolve around testing in two areas which differ in user ratings; the best, and the worst. From a poll that was conducted via The Age news agency the results shown a clear distinct difference between the Perth and Melbourne system. Perth, Transperth had the best ratings compared to the entire 8, whereas Melbourne, Myki, had the worst. </p>	
				<p> The benefits of testing in both areas which differs greatly is to observe whether the new PT system will work under different loads of stress. Perth having the best conditions is used as an initial testing ground to ask simple questions such as; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> Does the system work without errors?</li>
                                <li> Are users happy with the integration of the new system? </li>
				<li> Are all the old functions working without problems? </li>	
				<li> Are all the new functions working without problems? </li>
                                <li> Any feedback from the users? </li>
				<li> Is it easy to implement the system in an area with the best possible setting? </li>
                               
				</ul>	
				
					
				<p> As for Melbourne, the tests and questions will not differ much aside from the addition of; </p>
				
				<ul>
				
				<li> Is the system still able to work under a heavy load of work due to the increase in population? </li>
                                <li> What are the bugs or errors users find while using the system? </li>
				<li> Any issues for users to commute via multiple vehicles such as Train to Bus or Tram? </li>	
                               
				</ul>
				
					
				<p> Understanding that the new system is able to work under the best and the worst environments allows us to gain a better chance for a successful implementation amongst other states during the end-stage. In terms of rollouts during the end-stage we will mirror other transport systems during their phases where we start with certain sections and expand from that one point. </p>	
				<p> Other challenges that we will face revolves around external factors such as; the possibility of hacking, or simple human error. In terms of hacking we will have to device a solution to encrypt sensitive information to ensure safety of the user's personal information. And in terms of human error it ranges from something as simple as losing a card, to breaking one. One of the external main goal after all is still for the users to be satisfied with the final product, therefore user ratings are of high importance to us. </p>
				
					
					
					<h5> PTV Application and Card Integration </h5>
					
				<p> After some research on current systems both within and outside of Australia we’ve concluded the use of an NFC chip. These come in four different versions labelled respectively as Tags 1, to 4. Each tag has its own unique differences, uses, and costs however as the general rule dictates the bigger the number, the better the version and functionality. The rough summary of each tags are; </p>
				
				<ul>
                                
				<li> Tag 1 = Small capacity used to only store simple web addresses, very cheap, not really reliable for this project.  </li>
				<li> Tag 2 = Bigger capacity compared to Tag 1, very cheap, not compatible to various readers. Not really reliable for this project.  </li>	
				<li> Tag 3 = Large capacity compared to Tags 1 and 2, the most expensive compared to the 4 tags, exceeds in compatibility with various readers. We’ve decided to use a Tag 3 for our Initial Stage, especially during development for its compatibility.  </li>	
				<li> Tag 4 = Large capacity, similar to Tag 3, costs slightly less compared to Tag 3, not as compatible as Tag 3, still however offers a good range. Has better encryption than Tag 3. We will be using this tag for our end-stage roll outs which includes mass production of the new card system.  </li>
				
				</ul>
					
					
					<h5> Development </h5>
                                
				<p> As for the end products, aside from the card we have chosen to do an Android application which primarily also ties with the usage of current NFC chips installed within mobile phones. Using the android application users are able to gain access to multiple functions such as either topping up manually or automatically. The language we’ve chosen as our primary would be Java which is known to be friendly towards android software development. One issue we’ll face on the end-stage is migration towards other operating systems such as IOS that uses different forms of language. One of the side reasons on why we chose Android as a starter point is also primarily the cost of releasing an application in the playstore. For android the cost is only for 25$ whereas IOS would cost 100$ to release in the google store. </p>
					
					
					
					<h5> End Stage </h5>
					
				<p> With the assumption that the initial stage was successful the development end of the last stage would be as mentioned to expand towards other platforms such as IOS or a website base. The main difference will be the programming language that we will be using, React Native Javascript (RNJ) which has shown great compatibility across multiple platforms. The only issue is that React Native Javascript takes more time to develop due to the multiple tests conducted via various platforms. One main advantage of using this language when paired with its software is that the development team is able to ‘hot load’ the program which means they are able to see and test the differences as they code side by side without the need of turning anything on or off. </p>	
					
					
					<h5> Further Research and Other Jobs </h5>
					
				<p> Research shows there are 8 types of smart cards currently in use within Australia are </p>
				
				<ul>
                                
				<li> Brisbane = Go Card </li>
				<li> Melbourne = Myki Card </li>	
				<li> Sydney = Opal Card </li>
				<li> Adelaide = Metrocard </li>
				<li> Perth = SmartRider </li>
				<li> Hobart = Greencard </li>	
				<li> Canberra = MyWay </li>
				<li> Darwin = Tap & Ride Card </li>	
					
				</ul>
					
				<p> And if we compare it to another country such as Sweden, the entire county uses a contactless mastercard to pay for public transport. Only one system is used. </p>
				<p> As for professionals or additional help that the team will be looking into to aid in our project, we are required to hire; </p>
				
				<ul>
                                
				<li> A Java Programmer - To aid in the development of the program or application </li>
				<li> Front end developers to design the GUI for the mobile application </li>	
				<li> Various companies that ties with Visa and Mastercard for the Payment systems of this project (such as auto-top-up) </li>
					
				</ul>
