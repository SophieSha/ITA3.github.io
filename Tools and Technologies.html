					<h4 style="color:#000000"><b> RFID Technology for travel card </b></h4>
					
			        <p> RFID has a chip in it that is powered by a coil which on its own, is not enough to power the chip. However, when placed near an RFID reader, the chip and the reader complete a transformer that is capable of powering the chip as if it were connected to a battery.</p>
				<p> From reader to card, the reader changes the amplitude of AC voltage that powers the readers coil. The card is capable of detecting this change and, as a result, act on it. In order for the card to send information back to the reader, the card must short circuit its antenna through the use of a resistor and transistor. This will result in the readers coil consuming more power which the reader is aware of. The reader then receives the information from the chip by measuring the voltage over the resistor in the reader.</p>
				
					
				
					<h4 style="color:#000000"><b> Payment technology </b></h4>
				
			        <p> Topping up the card’s balance can be achieved at a Customer service desk or using existing payment machines found at most stations today. Cash and bank cards will be the available payment methods. However, those that create an account for the card will have additional payment methods available to them. Users will be able to set up automatic top ups through direct debit with their banks or use online payment methods like Paypal and Google Wallet. </p>
				
				
				
				
					<h4  style="color:#000000"><b> Hardware and Software </b></h4>
				
			        <p> As we plan on utilizing the current infrastructure that is already in place we have opted to use the MIFARE DESFire cards developed by NXP for our application. As NXP currently provide the transport cards for most of Australia, it would allow for an easy integration of the current systems. The MIFARE DESFire has multi-application capabilities and has better security feature compared to the other cards provided at NXP. Some of the encryption include DES, 2K3DES, 3K3DES, and AES hardware cryptography. </p>
				<p> The Company NXP provide basic code for the cards in the Java language for using the cards. As there is a structure already in place for an operating card, we plan on utilizing the information provided and altering to what we need for our cards to work across multiple platforms and be secure. We will try to utilize the card readers already in use by the government but for testing purposes we plan on using a readers from the PN7462 family as it has higher functionality. </p>
				<p> We plan on using the current NFC readers that are in place around the country as they will be supported with the cards we have chosen. We may need to investigate the current hardware used in the Northern Territory as this was the only region in Australia not currently using a MIFARE card.</p>
