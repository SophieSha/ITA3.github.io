					<h4 style="color:#000000"> Security </h4>
				
			        <p> As we will be dealing with cards containing a monetary value the security of the card will be a major risk in all stages of the project. As the cards will be held by the user at all times it will be impossible to monitor how the cards are used.
There has been a few cases of the cards we plan to use being copied (older versions)  one of the more recent published reports were from David Oswald and Christof Paar of Ruhr-University in Bochum, Germany. In October of 2011 they were able to successfully perform a side channel attack to be able to replicate a card. </p>
				<p> Some other Security related problems that could occur from misuse are
Hacking an RFID card with malicious intent is by no mean an easy feat, but it is possible. Some of the most common means this is done are listed below. </p>
				<p> Reverse Engineering – Involves taking apart the chip inside the card to figure out how it works with regards to how it sends and receives data. </p>
				<p> Power Analysis – Occurs when power level consumption of RFID tags is monitored. Especially true as power level is quite different between a correct and incorrect password. </p>
				<p> Eavesdropping and Replay – Unauthorized reader picks up communication between a reader and the card. This information can then be replayed later on to a receiving device to gain access or steal data. </p>
				<p> Sniffing - Same as eavesdropping except the data sent between card and reader is intercepted and changed. The original signal is diverted, and the manipulated data is sent instead whist purporting to be the intended signal in the RFID system. </p>	
				<p> While current encryption standards used will prevent some of these security issues it is something that will need to be reevaluated as security trends evolve or as encryption standards change. </p>
				
					
					<h4 style="color:#000000"> Card faults  </h4>
				
			        <p> As we are having a new card system we expect to experience some issues with the cards. Weather the cards break naturally or from misuse we will still need to have a solution on how to manage and fix issues to ensure users have a relatively hassle free experience. If a card happens to break it should be at no expense to user, especially if they happen to have their card checked from an inspector. The best solution to this issue that we have found is that once a user has a faulty card is it to be returned to selected train stations (which have staff in them), a temporary card will be issued with the same balance as the faulty card. If the user happened to recieve a fine on the journey to hand in their card, upon inspection of the card if it determined to be faulty the fine will be removed. </p>
				
				
					<h4 style="color:#000000"> Compatibility issues </h4>
				
			        <p> Tests in rural cities with public transport system might not give a true indication of how robust our new transport card is with using existing technology. The current card readers in place may operate slightly different and that may cause problems. I’m confident that we won’t have compatibility issues as most of the public transport systems around Australia are currently using a similar card (all transport systems are currently using a NXP card apart from Darwin).  </p>
				<p> Also as darwin are not currently using a card from NXP we believe we would have the most problems with compatibility there. While they do have NFC readers it is unsure how they will operate with our cards. As a worst case we may need to install compatible readers into the darwin smart card systems (on the Darwin bus fleet as well as at terminals for topping up). </p>
				
					
					<h4 style="color:#000000"> Co-operation  </h4>
				
			        <p> The greatest risk this project will face is the state governments no wanting to change the current public transport systems each of them have in place. With previous integrations of card systems costing a huge amount of money (Myki had a cost of over 1.4 billion dollars over 5 years) it is a real threat to the project. As each state government is run independently it may be a better strategy to approach areas with older transport systems in place as they may be more willing trail our project. </p>
				<p> If we were able to get the support of a state government and we implemented our card into their system it still won’t guarantee that other state governments will support or even consider integrating our product into their public transport system. While it would be a massive step to have an operating transport system to provide confidence for other state governments to agree to the project, ultimately it wouldn’t guarantee co-operation among them. </p>
