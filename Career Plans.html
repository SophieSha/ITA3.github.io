					<h4> Daniel - Full Stack Developer </h4>
				
			        <p> Becoming a full stack developer requires a decent working knowledge in a couple of programming languages. I plan on getting familiar with Client-side programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript through coursework and self study. This will give me the skills to products that are used by people in the real world i.e. A webpage or web application.</p>
				<p> I would follow the same iterative process for developing my server-side programming language repertoire. I plan on learning to code in Java, Python and SQL. In doing so, I would be able to retrieve, modify and store data in databases at the behest of users.</p>
			        <p> Whilst learning languages is all well and good, they don’t prepare you for what it would be like to work in the industry and the tools that they use. To gain better insight into this, I plan on going to various industry talks held at Uni as well as gain part-time employment in the IT field. In doing so, I’d be exposed to real world practices and build a network.</p>
				<p> By the time I graduate, I should have decent programming knowledge and some industry experience making it easier for me to gain full time employment in the field. By my estimation this plan should take about 3 - 5 years to complete.</p>
					
				
					<h4> Davin- Senior Java Developer </h4>
				
			        <p> My goal as a Senior Java Developer is quite lengthy in terms of time. Taken from my first assignment the job I would like to strive for still has not changed, the only main difference is the time I would require to achieve such a goal due to a further understanding of the level of quality required and the actual skills required to achieve this goal. The 3 year experience I will have from university will still be considered in the lengthy original 5 year time required for the job, however I will also need to take into account for work experience.</p>
				<p> Achieving various skills through either self-study, university or work experience. Some of these concepts are continuous throughout work and will most likely be never ending throughout my career depending on the progress of IT;</p>
				
				<ul>
					
			        <li> Java (OO Concepts, GoF Design Patterns)</li>
				<li> J2EE Concepts (JEE) & Design Patterns </li>
				<li> Servlets & JSP </li>
				<li> Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) </li>
				<li> Java Server Faces (JSF) </li>
				<li> Java Persistence API (JPA) </li>	
				<li> Various Application Servers such as; WebSphere, or GladFish </li>
				<li> Various Databases such as; Oracle, or SQL </li>
				<li> Other languages such as; CSS, HTML5 </li>
					
				</ul>  	
				
					
				<p> An estimate on how long it will take to achieve my chosen role when taken into consideration the work experience required is extended to 10-13 years instead of the initial 5-7. Additional skills that I believe will be achieved through work would be;</p>
				
					
				<ul>
					
			        <li> Advanced Java EE Concepts to develop various enterprise apps </li>
				<li> Development of web-based enterprise apps</li>
				<li> Ability to understand and use Servlets on an app server </li>
				<li> Ability to understand and use JSP on an app server </li>
				<li> EJB usage and integration to Cloud (Depending on company) EJB </li>
				<li> Development of various web applications with the use of; JSP / JPA / EJB / Servlet / JAS-WS and JAX-RS </li>	
				
				</ul>  	
					
				
				<p> To sum it up the first step is ultimately to finish off this degree, Bachelor of IT, and follow it up with either work or a master’s degree, or even both. In the meantime however it would be a juggle of both self-study and university related studies.</p>
				
				
					
					
					<h4> Shane- Cyber Security Specialist </h4>
				
			        <p> Over the time of the course my goals of working towards a security oriented career haven’t changed. Some of the steps to achieve this I have already started taking. The changes to the IT course structure provides a dedicated security stream which I intend to choose. I’ve listed some logical steps that i intend to take over the coming years and a few past achievements.</p>
				
				<ul>
					
			        <li> Join & attend an information security club through RMIT. </li>
				<li> Study and attempt to apply security concepts through CTF’s. </li>
				<li> Participated in Cysca ( didn’t expect to achieve much but used it as a learning experience). </li>
				<li> Choose my electives to go towards the security stream. </li>
				<li> Attend security talks/conferences for further knowledge and networking. </li>
				<li> Participate in future competitions for more ‘live’ experience (I plan on doing this in each year of my studies). </li>	
				<li> Try to apply for an internship in the security field during my studies for some real world experience.  </li>
				<li> After graduation apply for junior security roles </li>
					
				</ul>  
					
				<p> During the course of this semester I’ve managed to complete the first 3 points, although they are ongoing and i plan to continue participate in RISC (RMIT Information Security Collective) as I have learned so much from being involved. Earlier this semester I competed in a national security competition (Cysca)  where I was part of a team of 4, I plan on continuing to enter this competition each year as I found it a great environment to learn and apply skills. During my course I will try to find opportunities to gain security related certificates to improve my chances of success in this path.</p>
					
					
					
					<h4> Sophie- UI/UX Designer </h4>
				
			        <p> To be able to achieve my goal I have to successfully complete my bachelor degree of computing studies at RMIT. Being a good UI/UX designer means I must develop enough designing skills besides of IT front-end skills about HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and web/mobile application building. I would choose as many design related courses as possible within my university electives and IT electives. </p>
				<p> In-depth study of user-centered design and learning of using standard UI/UX softwares are essential because correctly understanding and interpreting users needs are the most important things for an UX designer. In order to improve my sense of aesthetics I would also practise my drawing skills and attend design and art related activities during university study. </p>
				<p> As a very important part of my career plan, finding a relevant Internship during second or third year would be really helpful for my work experience building. Getting to know about real world practices and be familiar with industry professionals would provide me more opportunities to gain my ideal job.</p>
					
					
					<h4> Wenshuo - Systems and Networks Administrator </h4>
				
			        <p> My ideal job as a qualified network administrator should have solid theoretical knowledge and application skills in six aspects: the network operating system, network database, network equipment, network management, network security and application development. I estimated that this plan should take about 3 - 4 years to complete including actual work experience.</p>
				<p> First of all, I am planning to take 3 years to achieve my bachelor of IT degree in RMIT, through coursework, lecture practical and self-study to gain various skills and relevant knowledge which include basic network platform construction, hardware equipment and security concept. I would also grasp various programming language such as HTML, CSS, JAVA, SQL and so on. In addition, my elective course options will primarily focus on business and enterprise IT system in the next few years. For example, information system design and solution, strategy and governance, digital innovation for business. In order to develop my back-end capabilities of the business system.</p>
				<p> On the other hand, I will also find some internship opportunities during my university period. Trying to accumulate working experience in an actual business environment. Such as how to set up local area network, IP address, quickly eliminate and analysis network faults or hardware failure solution for PC and data server.</p>
				<p> Furthermore, I plan to get a CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate) certification within 1-2 years after I graduate from university. CCNA is the composite exam associated with the Cisco Certified Network Associate Routing & Switching certification. This professional certification would help me a lot to get my ideal work position.</p>
				
					
					<h4> Common Elements of Ideal Jobs </h4>
				
			        <p> Because of ideal jobs requirements, most of group members are required to know basic IT knowledge and common front-end and back-end programming languages such as Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript, etc.</p>
				<p> Both Davin and Daniel’s ideal jobs were to be an software developer or programmer. Daniel's ideal job is to be a Full Stack Developer, as a full stack software developer which use functional knowledge of the full stack to take a concept and transform it into a complete product. Meanwhile, Davin wishes to strive as  a Java Developer. He would like to take part in the development of different types of programs or softwares ranging from a simple website to a program that could help develop prosthetic machinery or augmentation for humanity.</p>
				<p> Wenshuo and Shane share similar interest in ideal jobs, which both related to web management and security. To become a system and networks administrator requires Wenshuo to work with complex network environment. It mainly focuses on management and maintenance of the network and system. Shane wants to be a cybersecurity and risk analyst. The daily aspects of the job would entail managing and monitoring the current security systems, detecting and fixing vulnerabilities, monitoring intrusion attempts, help and educate staff when they believe something is suspicious and when there is a suspected security breach.</p>
				<p> All of our work positions requires teamwork, organizational skills, contributing and accomplishing different tasks with strong communication skills.</p>
				
					
					<h4> Differences of Ideal Jobs </h4>
				
			        <p> In regarding to Daniel's ideal job, he has to see the whole picture of the program and be able to use multiple skills to construct and build the frame of the product at front-end and/or back-end platforms. But Davin's ideal job is a highly specialized position which is only focused on software development based on Java language. It requires large amount of deep study in Java area.</p>
				<p> Wenshuo's working range as a network administrator is quite large and comprehensive but not very specific. The job is responsible for data update and security maintenance of the network site. It doesn’t really need high proficiency, but most of work must be properly understood. Shane's ideal job is more specialized than wenshuo's. Cybersecurity analyst must always be alert to security attacks from the network and ensure the advancement of security technology knowledge.</p>
				<p> Sophie’s ideal job has the least similarity compared to others. Besides general understanding for software knowledge about UI/UX web and mobile App designing, it also requires Sophie to practice digital drawing skills and basic skill requirement of ‘Creativity’.</p>
					
					
					<h4> Similarity / Differences of Career Plans </h4>
				
			        <p> In terms of the similarity of our career plans, because all of our ideal jobs require a minimum of 3 years relevant degree and/or industry experience, therefore most of the group members are planning to finish the bachelor degree in University as the first stage via choosing appropriate IT elective courses, spending large amount of time for self-study and attending IT related workshops and activities where possible. In addition, each people are planning to familiar with various basic programming language including HTML, Java, CSS or SQL. Besides, most of us plan to follow up with a relevant internship program at the late stage of university or after university study.</p>
				<p> Regarding to the differences of the career plans. Daniel plans to seek for a part-time employment during study, but Shane prefers to get internship for his industry experience, however Davin might be pursuing a postgraduate degree such as a Masters of IT or Masters of Computer Science in the future. As an enterprise networks administrator Wenshuo prefers to find internship position for work experience in business company at later stage of university study, but Shane has already been involved with plenty of RMIT IT related activities. For example he plans to participate in Cysca and some IT competitions every year to improve himself and gain more ‘live’ experience. Sophie’s career plan is a bit different from others, because an UX/UI designer  mainly works on front-end and contact users directly, except basic IT knowledge, it also requires her to have strong communication skills, excellent aesthetics and drawing skills. Sophie is planning to use university elective opportunities to study design courses during university.</p>
