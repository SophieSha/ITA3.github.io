			        <p> To be honest I had a fantastic experience. Everyone in the group was willing to work and communication was through the roof. Major differences can be seen from assignment 2’s group. As soon as assignment 3 was released, and assignment 2 ended, this group ‘Mooncake’ was formed. Aside from communication, we had an excessive amount of group meetings which everyone was happy to attend. The workload seemed fair and did not feel like a huge burden. If anything I would be happy to work with this group or any of its members again for either the next semester or future projects. </p>

			        <p> The team has been an absolute pleasure to work with as all members have a genuine interest in wanting to do well. A vast improvement over the efforts of my team from assignment 2.</p>
				<p> Our Assignment 3 group formed instantly over the lack of interest that former group members had towards work and attitude in general. I didn't feel like I was taken advantage of in terms of workload, in fact, people were willing to assist me as a result of my work and other commitments which was a nice change of pace. As in Assignment 2, we opted to use Discord as our main channel of communication. This proved fruitful as there is a steady flow of communication whether it be to check on assignment status, discussions or just to chat. </p>
				<p> I’ve learned a lot about teams this semester, especially in relation to conflict resolution and management. Reality is that we won’t always get to pick who we work with and being able to coexist is they key! </p>

			        <p> The group worked together really well, it was a very nice change as everyone wanted to do their part. One of the biggest changes in this group from previous groups that I’ve worked in at university is the team's ability to communicate. </p>
				<p> Our Group Mooncake was formed towards the end of assignment 2 as everyone involved happened to talk about their current group and the lack of drive or communication between its members. The most surprising part about this group is amount of communication, you always knew what needed to be done or if someone wasn’t going to be available due to other commitments. It definitely felt more like friends discussing things and trying to create something than students working together. As far as improvements go within the scope of the assignment I’d say there isn’t really much room for improvement, we worked together really well and allocated plenty of time to practise our presentation.  </p>
			        <p> What I’ve taken from my experience about working in groups is that everyone in this group has been more serious about working together on assignments. The mentality of everyone was much more mature and it could have been due to everyone being a little bit older. Overall the group was a pleasure to work in and in the future I’ll be looking forward to working with them if the chance arises again. </p>

			        <p> This group is definitely one of the best  university groups I’ve ever been in as everyone was super motivated, efficient and always eager to do more instead of pretending they don’t exist. Our group members almost communicate everyday through Discord channel and university time. Doesn’t matter whether our topics were the assignment related or not, we tried our best to build inner connections across the group and treat each other with decent respect.  Whenever someone calls out in the group for help always someone there online ready to give you a hand. </p>
				<p> Our group is special because we all knew what we want and what we can do for the group. The way of distributing tasks also maximize the use of each member’s talent and skills. People can contribute to the assignment in a way that they enjoy the most. I didn’t continue staying in my old group mainly because I was mentally exhausted as I had to act like a mum to push everyone working towards the group goal. Honestly, from this semester’s experience I did noticed that lots of school graduates in my classes did not really have enough motivation or care like mature students. (could be my bias because I’m too old...) Anyway, I enjoy this group experience very much and I’m looking forward to working with everyone again in future. </p>

			        <p> I have to say that this group cooperation is the most smooth and efficient one since I entered the university. Everyone is motivated to finish tasks with high quality. Based on my experience with Assignment 2,  before the assignment 3 was released, we identified team members and formed together. To ensure sufficient communication time, each of us attended  tutorial classes every week and organized many online meetings on discord channel. At the beginning stage , we reasonably distributed the task according to each team member's ability and actual situation. We don't really need to set a deadline because everyone tries their best to finish it ahead of time. There’s a very good phenomenon, when someone is free, will always ask ‘is there anything else for me to do?’ </p>
				<p> From my perspective, my team members are very excellent, they have achieved good results in other classes and speak good English language. To be honest, I think I'm ‘the worst one’ in my group. I was not confident at the beginning, because I was worried that I could not keep up with their progress. Fortunately, my group member are very nice and often encouraged me. They were willing to help me and patiently explain to me not only on the project knowledge, also in English communications, such as correct my pronunciation and grammar mistakes. At the same time, I try to make more contribution to this group. </p>	
				<p> We finished the presentation and assignment 3 together. In the process of teamwork, we have become very good friends. I am really looking forward to cooperating with this group again. </p>
