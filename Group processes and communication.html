			        <p> Taken from experience in Assignment 2 the lesson we’ve learnt is that communication is a key factor to the success of any project. Since our team was newly formed for Assignment 3, we did not have any proper means of dedicated communication yet. However as soon as the team was created we came together and a Discord server was organized dedicated to Assignment 3 to discuss the next steps. Two group members were given the task of setting up GitHub which will be used as means of submission, and everyone as a whole agreed to use Discord as our means of online communication.</p>
				<p> One of the benefits of the group is that each member had parallel schedules which complemented the project very well. To take just the class schedule into account all the group members would meet each other at least three times a week. One group member even moved classes in order to sync with the rest of the majority. Outside of class we would meet up at least once, twice, or at most three times a week to discuss progress and milestones for both the current week, and upcoming weeks. Overall our communication has been constant throughout the days of the week with rare occasions of a Sunday which the majority took a break from. </p>
				<p> We do not have members who lack in terms of communication or workload, due to the fact that this group was created exactly because of past experiences from Assignment 2. The members of Mooncake take both communication and equal workloads very seriously. However in the past of Assignment 2 we dealt with less motivated members through a set of chances. We would first give them the benefit of the doubt, and allow them more time to mend mistakes. Regardless if no progress is seen then we will opt to 3 choices; either we remove the member from the group, or we will leave the team to create a new group, or we will have to speak up and get someone of higher power to come aid in the problem. </p>
